**Matlab_version**: the most up-to-date matlab version of ICE.

**Python_version**: the python version of ICE. 

Currently, the most up-to-date version of ICE is the Matlab version, which is the same in the manuscript. The only two differences between the Python version and Matlab version are:

1). The clustering method. Python version needs manually set the number of clusters, while the Matlab version automatically generates fuzzy clusters without explicitly given the number of clusters.

2). The base machine learning package. The Python version uses scikit-learn base clssification algorithms, while Matlab version uses Weka base clssification algorithms.
